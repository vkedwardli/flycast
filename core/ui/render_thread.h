// While the game runs with threaded rendering, the frames are rendered and presented on a render thread and the main
// thread, which owns the window, only handles its events. A Present that waits for the display then no longer
// delays the input events: the main thread reads them as they arrive, not after its next Present.
// The rest stays on the main thread as before: the GUI, renderer changes and the window. The render thread runs
// only while none of them is needed and stops for them.
